Cleaning and Formatting Scripts

1. Make a backup of your Mongo dataset by creating a copy of the current collection (table). In mongoclient, run 'db.sb2018.copyTo('sb2018BACK')'. You will get a deprecated warning but it works. It takes time before the process finishes due to high number of tweets. It will display the number of records copied when done. 

2. identify valid time tweets (between start and end of game) and remove all invalid tweets (1_valid_tweets_during_game_time.py)

3. insert ad title to tweets (2_ad_adds_title_to_tweet.py). Before you run this script, you need to add all the hashtags for each ad into the script. See examples for 'budweiser' and 'pringles' in the script. 

4. insert brand to tweet (3_add_brand_names.py) 

5. add sentiment to tweet (4_add_sentiment.py)

6. add period into tweet (5_create_period.py)

7. count ads, brands, (see respective py scripts).

8. Push dataset from origin to destination server (8_push_dataset_to_another_VM.py)
